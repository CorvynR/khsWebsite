                    <hr>
                    <h2 id="august20">August 20 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> My son was in JROTC for the past two years here, and my daughter who is a freshmen was also accepted to the program.
                     Both of them are doing virtual; saying that, I haven't seen anything regarding students in their situation regarding JROTC this year.
                     Are they still able to attend?</em>
                   </p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> JROTC is unfortunately not available to students in the virtual environment.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> I heard students are not allowed to carry their backpacks to class and will have to use their lockers in transition times.
                     Won't this cause more personal contact with them all trying to squeeze into their lockers--most of which are top and bottom--at the same time instead of simply walking to their next class?</em>
                    </p>
                     <p><b>A:</b> KHS will be limiting times that students may visit their lockersm and will be closely monitored throughout.</p>
                    <h2 id="august19">August 19 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> When the students transition from class to class, will they all be walking in the same direction so they are not coming face to face?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> The corridors of KHS are such that students can transition between classes while maintaining appropriate physical distancing without having to require one way traffic.
                     In our commons, there are two sets of stairs which will be designated for one way traffic.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will there be after-school activities such as Cyberpatriots, National Technical Honors Society, sports, or other extracurriculars?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Yes, we will have after school activities, but they will be modified in some format.
                     Sports for the fall will include Cheer, Singles Tennis, Cross Country, and Golf. Winter and Spring sports have not been decided yet.
                     Other activities can be held with attention to physical distancing guidelines considered. Those clubs will be anounced at a later date.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="august18">August 18 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Is Lunchtime Live still going to be a thing?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Lunchtime Live is legend-<em>wait for it...</em>-dary in our community! For those of you who don't know what this is,
                     it is a venue that KHS gives to students to share a talent during lunch. There are dance routines, songs, skits, and much more.
                     I can't wait to see this in person. Let's hope thhat we can get that geared up early!
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> There is a Facebook KHS Town Hall on August 18, and some families do not have Facebook and may choose not to have such social media.
                     Are there other ways for parents to stay connected?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Absolutely, I will update this page frequently for questions and answers. Additionally, we will always utilize this website for information.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Where will students go to on the first day of virtual school? Should we check Schoology or wait for an email from our new teachers?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Students who utilize the virtual option will recieve notification from the DODEA Virtual School with specifics.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> If students complete their Senior year with the virtual school, will they be able to participate in the KHS graduation ceremony or festivities?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Once a Raider, Always a Raider. We would welcome full participation of all KHS students.</p>
                    <h2 id="august17">August 17 Additions</h2>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Can we wear face shields instead of face masks?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Good question; unfortunately no. DODEA requirements is that all staff, students, and visitors must wear a cloth face covering.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> I have multiple students at the school. If one of my kids is feeling sick, should I keep them all home?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b>If you have a child in your home that is showing any signs of Covid-19, please consider keeping each of your students home. This would apply to any of our schools,
                     and once you have been declared by a physician, or symptoms subside, you may send your students to school. If you are ever needing guidance, please reach out to our school nurse.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will we still be using the new rotation bell schedule or keeping red and white days?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We will be using the red and white day schedule that was utilized last school year. The first day of school, August 24, will be a red day.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Will the seniors have all of their senior activities and trips?</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> All activities and trips for any grade level are canceled to the fall. When we return to HPCON-Alpha, our district and our local command teams will offer guidance on which activities may return as normal.
                     You will have frequent updates from our Senior Sponsors this year with specific details. We encourage all senior parents to get involved in our Senior Committee, and be on the lookout for more details.
                    </p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> Can a student doing virtual school use supplies from the school, with parents coming to the school to pick them up? (Supplies like art supplies, pieces of huge colored banner paper rolls, card stock, etc.)</em></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Parents/Guardians of students utilizing the virtual option will need to supply all items for instruction at home.</p>
                    <p><em><b>Q:</b> How many classes should virtual students have?</em>  </p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Students should have 5 virtual school courses. In some cases, students in the virtual school option do not have a full schedule due to an incomplete course request submitted in the spring.
                     Additionally, some schedules are incomplete due to courses being requested that the DODEA Virtual School does not offer. Navigate to the 'Counseling' page under the 'Students' dropdown to find your student's counselor contact information.</p>
